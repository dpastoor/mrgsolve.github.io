# Simulated output

When `mrgsim` is used to simulate from a model, it returns an object with class `mrgsims`.  It is an S4 object containing a matrix of simulated output and a handful of other pieces of data related to the simulation run.  

`mrgsolve` provides several methods for working with `mrgsims` objects or coercing the simulation matrix into other `R` objects.

## Coersion methods

* `as.data.frame` convert to `data.frame`
* `as.matrix` convert to `matrix`
* `as.tbl` convert to `tbl`


## Query methods
* `head`
* `tail`
* `names`
* `dim`
* `summary`
* `show`
* `$`


## Methods for `dplyr` verbs
`mrgsolve` provides several S3 methods to make it possible to include `dplyr` verbs in your simulation pipeline. 

For example
```{r}
library(dplyr)

mod <- mrgsolve:::house()

mod %>% 
  ev(amt=100) %>%
  mrgsim %>% 
  filter(time >=10)
```

Here, `mrgsim` returns an `mrgsims` object.  When `dplyr` is also loaded, this object can be piped directly to `dplyr::summarise`.

Other `dplyr` functions that can be used with `mrgsims` objects

* `group_by`
* `mutate`
* `filter`
* `summarise`
* `select`
* `slice`
* `summarise.each` (use a `<dot>` not an `<underscore>`)
